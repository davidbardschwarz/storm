    <p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>Once you emerse yourself in the slow motion and the details of each of the people waiting, 
  perhaps for a subway, there is the shocking appearance of a deluge of water. Freud describes such a moment of shock as follows: 
      "(Shreck) is the name of the condition to which one is reduced if one encounters a danger without being prepared for it" (Freud 144).</p>
